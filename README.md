### Adding useful HTMLS Useful unblocked websites and etc etc.

### Version: 1.3.8 (Added 3 folders that are called: Best Javascripts, And Javascript's. And I added 5 HTML'S bookmarklets. And I also added 2 websites to help you probably do smth or idk.) 

Make a Issue If you have any Website/Htmls. etc etc so I can add them.

If you wanna make a HTML bookmarklet to work go to: (https://ashtondavies.github.io/LoMoH/?unlock). Make sure you have the HTML code/JavaScript code so It can work.

Javascript and HTML file converter link: (.https://caiorss.github.io/bookmarklet-maker/). 



### Useful Websites: 1. (https://grapesjs.com/demo). Reason: Can help you make your own website In HTML and etc etc.

### Useful Websites  2. (If you don't understand how to do this go to https://github.com/3kh0/ext-remover?tab=readme-ov-file#downgrading--change-versions to learn how to do the rigtool thingy idk man)

Step One:
Open this link on the bottom of the text and just leave it alone. (Note: This will not run code it's just there to fix the second page.)                      
  
### Copy me and go to a new tab and paste It and press enter!                                                                                  
                                    
                devtools://devtools/bundled/devtools_app.html


### Now do the same thing!

###   

    devtools://devtools/bundled/devtools_app.html?experiments=true&ws=rig.kxtz.dev/             
  
Now when you did that go to the second page. Make sure the page url Is: devtools://devtools/bundled/devtools_app.html?experiments=true&ws=rig.kxtz.dev/. And not: devtools://devtools/bundled/devtools_app.html.


This will fix to fix the first page or second Idk really at this point. But devtools://devtools/bundled/devtools_app.html can't run code but this can: devtools://devtools/bundled/devtools_app.html?experiments=true&ws=rig.kxtz.dev/.


Now when ur In the second page or first page with this url: devtools://devtools/bundled/devtools_app.html?experiments=true&ws=rig.kxtz.dev/ Press Network and find a gray box next to a text called: Name. Now when you do that, double-click the black/grey box on the network tab after u did that some websites are gonna pop up, do not worry it isn't gonna steal your data i did it and it never did. Yw. But if you dont see the black/grey box on the network tab go to https://github.com/3kh0/ext-remover?tab=readme-ov-file#downgrading--change-versions to learn how to do it easier. Make sure It Isn't devtools://devtools/bundled/devtools_app.html In the url If it is try to go to here: devtools://devtools/bundled/devtools_app.html 
experiments=true&ws=rig.kxtz.dev/
