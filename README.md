# Adding useful HTMLS Useful unblocked websites and etc etc.

## Version: 1.4 (Added a website that can run Javascript code. And added 2 HTML bookmarklets.)

 Make a Issue If you have any Website/Htmls. etc etc so I can add them.

If you wanna make a HTML bookmarklet to work go to: (https://ashtondavies.github.io/LoMoH/?unlock). Make sure you have the HTML code/JavaScript code so It can work.

Also I am gonna find a website to convert HTML code to Javascript.
